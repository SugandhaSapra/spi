####Technologies

I have illustrated using 3 applications

1.**[greeter-app1](/greeter-app1)**

This will let you understand how to load the desired implementations within same module.

2.**[greeter-app2](/greeter-app2)**

This will let you understand how to load the desired implementations across multiple modules.

3.**[greeter-app3](/greeter-app3)**

This will let you understand how to load the desired implementations across multiple modules using java 9 modules.
